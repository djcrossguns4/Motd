Sorry for the update taking SOOOOOOO long but it's finally here yay.

Forest and some maps got revamp due to old forest was lagging the whole game so i decide to revamp it
and some of new stuff added into the new forest with

gamemodes, better computer, cosmetics, ropes, ziplines, size changer, switching PhotonVR to my own VR Manager (Where you can grab cosmetics on your arms) and other games like Capture the flag in the computer.
